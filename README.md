# FootSim 

Simulating peripheral tactile responses from the sole of the foot.

# The FootSim package has not been released yet

It is expected to be available after its journal publication, mid-2022. This toolbox requires footsim to be installed, therefore is for visualisation only. It validates the FootSim package using empirically recorded neuronal data. 

All documentation is written in standard docstring format. 

If using conda for package management, the following command creates a new environment fs with all dependencies installed: conda env create -f environment.yml
